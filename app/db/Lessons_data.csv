TP003A,07/11/2017,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,FMT Feedback,Due to the lack of the feedback loop and the nature of PPFD work there were delays in getting feedback to the FMT . On serval occiasions this meant that the feedback when recieved was considerably out of date.
TP003A,07/11/2017,Communications,WWW,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Stakeholder Communication,It was felt that the communication and engagement between the various staekholder groups was very good and worked well. Op's particularly felt that the communicatons from the BCM and project were excellent and ensured that the OP's job was as easy as possible re comm's to staff. The level of communications between all stakeholders also allowed for the development of good working relationships between stakeholders
TP003A,07/11/2017,Communications,WWW,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Briefings/Viewpoints,The briefings and viewpoints for facial matching went well and were well received thus ensuring that staff were fully informed prior to deployments. They were delivered in an engaging manner and provided adequate time of examiners to ask questions etc
TP003A,07/11/2017,Communications,WWW,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,The content of documentation/FAQS etc,"The FAQ's, desk aid, etc were comprehnsive and fully covered the FMS. This ensured that staff were fully equiped and had easily accessable documentation to refer to in the event of an issue, minimising disruption to the business"
TP003A,07/11/2017,Communications,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Reissue Com's,Given the elongated roll out it was felt that additional targeted com's would have been beneficial to ensure engagement from sites that have already been rolled out. E.g. Provide them with future versions of the FAQ's etc
TP003A,07/11/2017,Communications,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Stakeholder Com's,It was felt at certain points communications were missing the engagement and involvement of key players. Ensuring that all key players were fully involved all points would mitigate against this
TP003A,07/11/2017,Communications,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Teleproformance,There was insufficent communications and engagement with
TP003A,07/11/2017,Communications,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Initial Length of Com's,Initially the length of com's led to some disengagement from examination due to the volume. This was addressed in later rollouts
TP003A,07/11/2017,Communications,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,FMT Planning,Plans for the future were not communicated in good time to the FMT leaving them unaware of the direction the project was moving towards. Due to the nature of UKVI contracts (AWL) planning for the future is important
TP003A,07/11/2017,Strategy,WWW,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Deployment Support,The strategy for deployment worked well and ensured there was enough coverage and support in each site
TP003A,07/11/2017,Strategy,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Unforeseen Evens,Some unforseen events such as the 16 Year old issue could possibily been avoided through closer scrutiny of policy at an early stage.
TP003A,07/11/2017,Testing,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,1:1 Check Performance,There are a number of issues that appear to be associated with the 1:1 check that were unforeseen and have caused issues. Had these issues been picked up in the testing phase it would have reduced the workload in the current phase of deployment
TP003A,07/11/2017,Testing,WWW,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Operations Inclusion,Good use of operations staff in testing led to a sense of inclusion/ownership over the work
TP003A,07/11/2017,Testing,WWW,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,BAT Testing/Silent Running,The BAT testing and Silent Running provided the business with confidence in the system and its resilience.
TP003A,07/11/2017,Resources,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,There were a number of changes of project team members during the FM Project including the leads for both HMPO & HOB.,"This caused a loss of continuity and knowledge which then had to be built up by incoming staff, in addition to having to build new working relationships."
TP003A,07/11/2017,Resources,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Sufficient time needs to be allocated to ensure staff recruitment in place for planned  release dates.,"Due to initial low work levels within FMT, recruitment of additional FMT staff was not prioritised.  As a result, roll out to further sites had to be delayed whilst additional staff needed to handle the higher work levels within FMT, were recruited. This was further hindered by leavers."
TP003A,07/11/2017,Resources,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,"Initial low work levels within FMT, caused us to lose some staff who were not fully utilised.",As above
TP003A,07/11/2017,Resources,WWW,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,A good pooling of resources from both FMT/Project/PPFD to assist in the FMT recuritment,Ensured that there was sufficent resources to allow the recuritment to occur seemlessly once the process began
TP003A,07/11/2017,Resources,WWW,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Site Support,There were adequate resources in place to support each phase of the roll out ensure local staff were well equipped to manage the change
TP003A,07/11/2017,Resources,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,UKVI Working Hours/Contracts,"HMPO did not have enough knowledge of UKVI contracting practises that meant UKVI did not know the volumes / timeframes for the delivery work. This caused problems for forward planning and in some cases increased costs, premium hour working etc"
TP003A,07/11/2017,Resources,WWW,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Good Teamwork,"Good teramwork was displayed across the Project, Op's, PPFD and the FMT"
TP003A,07/11/2017,Resources,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Initial Training,In the early stages it was felt that there was initially a lack of training delivery. This was addressed in later stages of the deployment.
TP003A,07/11/2017,Communications,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,AMS reporting,"There were a number of delays experience in getting the AMS reports in place, which could have been managered more effectively, with better communications in place"
TP003A,07/11/2017,Management,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,HMPO/UKVI links,For business continuity purposes better links between HMPO and the UKVI FMT are required in the event of another incident occuring.  Similiarly where work arounds are being utilised all parties should know as it may impact e.g. IABSweb
TP003A,07/11/2017,Assurance,WWW,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Lessons were learned from the 1st CAM,"The first CAM was a paper CAM, lessons were learned for future CAMS making the first CAM the only paper CAM"
TP003A,07/11/2017,Management,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Contingency+Recovery,
TP003A,07/11/2017,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Responses,There was a lack f responses from stakeholders and interestd parties during the creation of the BCDR
TP003A,07/11/2017,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,Meetings,The initial meetings and workshops that led to the creation of the BCDR went well and were fruitful
TP003A,07/11/2017,Communications,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,BCDR,The BCDR was not signed off or communicated out. During the incident this led to confusion. Similarly the lack of an updated contacts ment that people involved with the system were not made aware of any issue until later in the day. It was also agreed that there was no clear structure or chain of command.
TP003A,07/11/2017,Resources,EBI,Project Team,Project,LL Workshop,5,,,PPFD Back up,If there was capacity across PPFD to offer back up and support during incidents
TP007B,01/08/2017,Governance,EBI,Initiation Stage,Project Team,Project,5,,,"All possible solutions to domestic VIS seem not to have been explored in early discussions with small group of people, not enough knowledge of VIS and how it worked",Impact: The lack of a full and transparent exploration of all solutions and the lack of knowledge on current solution to support this project has been prohibitive in decision making.
TP007B,01/08/2017,Design,EBI,Initiation Stage,Project Team,Project,5,,,"Where all options explored by all stakeholders? - With earlier discussions including all stakeholders it may have led to some different options being discovered with possible cost savings,",Impact: Now with the current delivery timelines only three options seem to be available to choose from and now becomes a very muddy and messy Project which could have been avoided with more clarity and earlier and better communication from all stakeholders.
TP007B,01/08/2017,Design,EBI,Initiation Stage,Project Team,Project,5,,,"Difficult to find any good documentation on exactly how a VIS interview is processed from start to finish and what IT/Telephony hardware/software is used during interview to allow a better understanding of ScopeRequirements,",Impact: The benefit of these documents to identify all current solution used would also have helped final solution delivery
TP007B,01/08/2017,Communications,EBI,Initiation Stage,Project Team,Project,5,,,"Not enough engagement/communication with the staff that had the knowledge about VIS early in Project, Giovanni Ercolino is good example of someone with a good knowledge base about how VIS works and all ScopeRequirements",Benefit : Giovanni Ercolino  has just recently been asked to engage in Project and has shared more information on the exact requiremnts from HMPO/LA staff and their VIS  function than from any other process.
TP007B,01/08/2017,Technology,EBI,Delivery,Project Team,Project,5,,,"Current contracts with the five Aijlon sites seem very muddy, why is the Project just finding this information out now?",Impact: Failure to fully impact assess could result in HMPO left with funding the Wi- Fi/IT Hardware and not have budgeted for it resulting incorrect cost forecast.to project during the initial high level impacts assessment
TP007B,01/08/2017,Communications,EBI,Delivery,Project Team,Project,5,,,Communication! - Seems that a lot of discussions early in the Project where not communicated correctly to all stakeholders,Impact: Failure to share knowledge could fully impact Project and be  the consequences of delays to delivery.
TP007B,01/08/2017,Governance,EBI,Delivery,Project Team,Project,5,,,The Xcryptor tool expires in December this year!  this is the security tool for user Password resets/lockouts and it impacts all HMPO RAS users as well.,Impact : Because it affects all agency HMPO RAS users  it suddenly became an issue. The project are looking at solutions but it should really have been on everyone’s radar from the beginning.
TP007B,01/08/2017,Design,EBI,Initiation Stage,Project Team,Project,5,,,Delays in Design approach could result in additional cost,Impact:  Any cost incurred by HMPO from DXC   could have been avoided by more clarity and decision making very early in the project by the main stakeholder’s
TP007B,07/08/2017,Stakeholders,EBI,,Project Team,,5,,,Design Workshop that was held with the project once handed over should have the key stakeholders involved.,
TP007B,07/03/2018,Design,EBI,Design Stage,Project Team,TDA/BDA,5,,,Change of decision from DXC to in-house build was made by limited teams and did not involve all of the key decision makers and the end users.  This was managed by BDA and not all users were involved.,Impact:  Signicant part of the Project team's time was focussed on making the design fit.
TP007B,07/03/2018,Management,EBI,Design Stage,Project Team,TDA/BDA,5,,,Not all business ScopeRequirements were captured at design stage which resulted in a number of workarounds being put in place to support the service.,Impact:  Level 2 support was unclear due to lack of engagement with Service Management Teams when decisions were made to do an in-house build Impact: The later the decisions are made the more difficult it is to put service management practices around.   Impact:  Service management aspects are taking longer than usual due to ownership of service management aspects not being agreed at design stage. Impact: Made a decision to do an in-house build without fully understanding the implications of this decision
TP007B,07/03/2018,Security,EBI,Design Stage,Project Team,TDA/BDA,5,,,All projects kicked off at BDA level should  follow the Cyber and Security Evaluation Process.  This should be part of the handover process to the Project.,Impact: Significant amount of work with Security was spent trying to resolve issues that were occurring with the build due to system lock down approach.
TP007B,07/03/2018,Management,EBI,Implementation,Project Team,,5,,,First Level support should meet customer needs.,Benefit:  When a problem occurs the LA sites are already liaising with Hub sites (Glasgow or Belfast) as part of the interview process and therefore they are the first port of call despite the process requiring staff to call the helpdesk. Impact:  The fault that is being dealt with between LA site and Hub sites also need to be raised with the helpdesk. Impact:  The DDaT Helpdesk are not fully clear on the new VIS process and therefore the Hub site often has to talk them through the process - which is counter-productive
TP007B,07/03/2018,Management,EBI,Design/Implementation,Project Team,Design/ Project,5,,,No level 2 support in place to help with the build or roll out resulted in individuals having to try and resolve issues themselves additional to day job,Impact:  DDAT processes did not meet all of the Service Management ScopeRequirements of the project - which resulted on additional built on support being provided by Kato to wrap around the existing HODDAT Process Impact: Level 2 should have  a dedicated support system and should not be relying on people within the wider project team.
TP007B,07/03/2018,Management,EBI,Design Phase,Project Team,Design,5,,,Future projects should follow the DDAT Service Design On boarding Process (18 point process) going forward - this was not fully in place for VIS.  This will ensure that projects are aware of the on boarding process.,Impact:  the Service Management Team were trying to provide an ad hoc process around the new design - which resulted in additional work in additional time and resource to address the Business ScopeRequirements.
TP007B,07/03/2018,Security,EBI,Design,Project Team,Design,5,,,Lock down on the Kiosk build was too restrictive.,"Benefit:  Very proactive response from Security to address issues against very short timescales. Once a problem had been identified - the process for assessing the problem, identifying the problem, seeking security approval, implementing, testing and rolling out managed occurred between the Friday of identifying the problem and Wednesday when it was rolled out. Benefit:  Excellent engagement between the project and security to enable agile iterations to develop. Impact:  The security architect was limited in what they were involved in due to the pressures of other activities going on."
TP007B,07/03/2018,Security,EBI,Implementation,Project Team,Project,5,,,"Patching, syops, CASE problems - had been left until after delivery as had not been picked up until later in the project.",Impact:  Security had to risk assess outstanding activities to enable project to proceed within timescales.
TP007B,07/03/2018,Design,EBI,Design,Project Team,Project,5,,,Insufficient timescales to carry out an in-house build,"Impact:  Decisions were being made due to the time constraint of the expiry of the Xcryptor in December, which may have not been the solution chosen if more time had been allowed. Impact:  The Design was being carried out by one individual during out of hours and weekend in order to meet the deadline"
TP007B,07/03/2018,Design,EBI,Design,Project Team,Design,5,,,Laptop purchased did not have the required Ethernet connection,Impact:  Additional hardware was procured at short notice to enable appropriate connectivity. Impact:  Laptops were not looked at until build was due to commence Impact:  Spec of laptops were not fully defined before procuring the laptops
TP007B,07/03/2018,Commercial,EBI,Build,Project Team,Project,5,,,The Adelphi procurement process  was slow and resulted in a number of purchases being made on Corporate credit cards or via personal credit cards and claimed back under T,Impact:  Corporate or personal credit cards had to be used to procure items at short notice to meet the deadlines required.
TP007B,07/03/2018,Testing,EBI,,Project Team,,5,,,Suitable testing environments were not available and resulted in testing being done at home.,"Benefit:  Being able to take pictures and send them via What’s App were invaluable to be able to identify any problems. Impact:  Difficulty in CAB, Security and Service Management in getting approval to use a live solution for test."
TP007B,07/03/2018,Assurance,EBI,Implementation,Project Team,Project,5,,,"There were difficulties experienced with engaging with the CAB Process, which resulted in additional time and effort by a number of stakeholders at short notice.",Impact:  Require continued engagement with CAB Impact: CAB process can result in a single point of failure if key CAB resources cannot be contacted.
TP007B,07/03/2018,Testing,EBI,Testing/ Implementation,Project Team,Project,5,,,The testing and implementation approach were dictated by the deadlines of the Xcryptor and the Ajilon contract ending in December.,"Impact:  Due to the tight timescales the Implementation approach of roll out and test was revised to ensure that laptops were available on sites before the Xcryptor expiry at the end of December 17. Impact:  Difficulty in CAB, Security and Service Management in getting approval to use a live solution for test."
TP007B,07/03/2018,Deployment,WWW,Implementation,Project Team,Communications,5,,,"The VIS Hub sites, Project Team and LA sites worked well together to deliver the new VIS solution",Benefit:  Operations were pleased that the roll out schedule was determined by themselves rather than by the Project Benefit:  The interaction of the project with the local authorities resulted in a better interaction with staff and also resulted in understanding IT limitations Benefit:  Having technical support for Belfast was invaluable for the local team at go live Benefit:  Providing advance notice of any problem to the Head of Ops worked we so that problems could be managed in advance.
TP007B,07/03/2018,Deployment,WWW,Implementation,Project Team,Communications,5,,,Deployment to remote sites had varying levels of success,"Impact:  delay in getting certain offices logged on, resulting in continued operation of Communicator or using contingency. Impact:  Disengagement by LA staff who have difficulties accessing the new system Impact:  Lack of knowledge of when the go live date would be resulted in an impact on the  operational scheduling Impact:  Additional security hurdles re carrying the VIS laptops out to offices.  This should not have been an issue as work laptops"
TP007B,07/03/2018,Deployment,WWW,Implementation,Project Team,Go Live,5,,,Considerable effort was required by a relatively small team to roll out this implementation and support the Hub and Local Authority sites.,Benefit:  The Wider project team was very flexible and interchangeable. Benefit:  Non gradist - everyone just had roles.
TP007B,07/03/2018,Commercial,EBI,Implementation,Project Team,Build,5,,,Procurements caused delays to the project,Impact:  Delay in procurement process meant that there was no progress on ordering urgent laptops for 4 weeks.  Impact:  Duplication of orders meant additional time and effort sending duplicate order back.
TP007B,07/03/2018,Commercial,EBI,Build,Project Team,Procurement,5,,,The Procurement of the telephony lines did not progress smoothly.,Impact:  the Go live date was delayed while waiting for telephony at key sites. Impact:  Procurement and installation of telephony lines took longer than the estimated timelines Impact:  Timescales of telephony lines resulted in Operations having to operate in contingency mode at various locations for a short period. Benefit:  Crown Commercial provided a good service in procurement the lines - responded very quickly to the project.
TP007B,10/07/2018,Commercial,EBI,Build,Project Team,Procurement,5,,,HO Commercial must be involved in Procurement activity,Impact:  Significant piece of work with HO Commercial post contract award to align invoices Impact:  Contract signed by Portfolio Director when it should be HO Commercial Impact:  Procurement had not been included on HO Atamis Contract system.
TP10B,05/06/2018,Governance,EBI,Ruth Gracias / Teri Starr / Steven Sibbald,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,"Key information on solution change  was not shared with entire project team -  the team expected a bespoke report for transfer of email data to DHL as had been  initially discussed  but it transpired that this would not be available.  Although this had apparently been discussed at a senior level , this information was not shared with key team members.","Impact: Resulted in delays in developing and agreeing a solution and in commissioning activity from the supplier.   Impact: Unsuitable elements were not identified as such, which impacted on project's timescale."
TP10B,24/04/2018,Governance,EBI,Teri Starr,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,Some of the documents project team provided to the Supplier were incomplete or in various formats (Word/Excel) which got the Supplier confused and impacted on delivery of the solution.  There was not enough clarity on some of the documents project team provided to DHL.,Impact:  This caused  delay to Stage 1 Go Live.
TP10B,09/05/2018,Governance,EBI,Simbo Lawal / Steven Sibbald,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,DHL Technical team was only invited to workshops towards the end of project lifecycle.,Impact: Slow progress (in terms of agreeing solution) made as project got to the more technical aspects.  Impact: Outputs from workshops could have been better if the DHL technical team had been invited to meetings from onset.
TP10B,09/05/2018,Testing,WWW,Teri Starr,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,"Project team carefully checked DHL’s exception criteria and spotted it was incomplete, prior to Customer Communication Stage 1 (supporting documents) go live date.","Benefit: As a result of thorough checking carried out, the project team was able to put the brakes on and ensure that when project went live, we delivered a product that was fit for purpose."
TP10B,29/05/2018,Testing,EBI,Natalie Hayes,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,"No solution design documents were provided for review and approval from the Supplier, details given were fairly vague and not fully clear until attending the testing at DHL site the day before the scheduled go live date.","Impact: The proposed changes to the solution are fully understood and testing can be planned in advance. This gives the project and test teams time to review the changes to ensure they are fit for purpose, it also allows the tester to plan the test approach and identify the high risk areas."
TP10B,29/05/2018,Testing,EBI,Natalie Hayes,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,Testing happened the day prior to the proposed go live date.,Benefit: Protects the schedule if  issues are found in test.  Impact: Go live was delayed to fix the gaps in the exception criteria found during testing.
TP10B,29/05/2018,Testing,EBI,Natalie Hayes,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,Testing would have been smoother if the exception data had been set up in advance by the Supplier.,Impact: More exceptions could have been checked during testing if exception data had been set up in advance.   Impact: There was communication gap with regards to document versions and different team members and suppliers worked with different versions of testing documents.
TP10B,29/05/2018,Testing,WWW,Natalie Hayes,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,The Supplier development team were very helpful on the day of testing and were able to explain the solution well.,Benefit: This gave confidence that the solution would meet HMPO's requirement but it was a little last minute.
TP10B,30/05/2018,Governance,WWW,Janna Di Muccio,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,Excellent communications between Project and CAT leads made for a smooth handover of the CAM for Stage 2 (passports).,"Benefit: Timely updates and joined up communications between stakeholders facilitated a smooth, correspondence CAM."
TP10B,05/06/2018,Governance,WWW,Ruth Gracias,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,Project team insisted on testing whether One Track could be accommodated at DHL's international Contact centres.,Benefit: Found that this key requirement could not currently be accommodated

TP10B,05/06/2018,Governance,EBI,Ruth Gracias,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,Some team members were inconsistent in attending meetings.,"Impact: Not all information was brought to the team, Chinese whispers prevented progress,  some team members were not up to date and having to play catch-up."
TP10B,05/06/2018,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Ruth Gracias,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,Clearly defined and detailed ScopeRequirements for the supplier and detailed solution design documents from the supplier are critical to avoid potential misunderstanding and stalled activity.  ScopeRequirements were too high level.,"Impact: As possibilities were explored, ideas discounted and solutions evolved agreements with supplier and commitments from the supplier were often verbal and then required further exploration, reminders or challenge"
TP10B,05/06/2018,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Ruth Gracias,SD Int One Track,LL Workshop,5,,,The value of One Track to the customer was assumed before  we understood the  full customer Comms solution (which does not depend on One Track). In hindsight we should have understood the full solution for Customer Comms and One Track before delivering. anything.,Impact: One Track was implemented in advance of Customer Communications and created difficulties for IDT and TP requiring a workaround yet the benefits of One Track for the customer have not been realised.
TP10B,05/06/2018,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Ruth Gracias,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,At an early stage supplier said it would not be feasible to utilise the supporting document manifest data to provide email address for each respective customer's  passport delivery. Some 6 or 7 months later that is the solution we implemented,Impact: Delays to project delivery
TP10B,11/06/2018,Governance,EBI,Ben Quince,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,"HMPO Internal system restrictions (AMS,OCF etc) Denied parties, email addresses, full names etc.  The Supplier (DHL) did not come up with acceptable solution for Customer Communication.",Impact: Goal posts for delivery moved several time throughout the project

TP10B,13/06/2018,Stakeholders,EBI,Steven Sibbald,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,There were no payment milestones in the contract.,Impact: DHL were not incentivised to resource transition and make it happen within an appropriate timescale.
TP10B,13/06/2018,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Steven Sibbald,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,Limitations of OCF/OCF2 as solution to customer communication.,Impact: This meant that we could not have a simple solution of just sending the overseas customers e-mail addresses via the manifest information.
TP10B,13/06/2018,Governance,EBI,Sharon Jordan,SD Int Customer communication,LL Workshop,5,,,Decision by the project SRO / working group left team with only 10 days to carry out Change Assurance (CAM) and some other project tasks during both stages 1 and 2 of project.,Benefit: Project team worked well together to pull together necessary documents within the 10 days timescale.  Impact: Timescale too short for required tasks.
PT002,09/09/2016,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"Lack of reward and recognition, and continued reliance on individual goodwill","Project staff felt they were continually expected to work away from home for long periods of time, perform excessive working hours including week-ends and late nights, with an expectation that the team would be willing to forgo a satisfactory work-life balance out of sheer commitment or loyalty to the organisation."
PT002,09/09/2016,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"Lack of clarity around roles, responsibilities and overall governance between project and local team",The project team were at times required to make decisions on behalf of local management and then failed to receive the support of local management in executing these. There were also conflicting messages being provided at times between local management and the project team.
PT002,09/09/2016,Technology,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,IT Dependencies,"Specifically in relation to transitioning the bulk scanning solution used by HMPO’s BPO partners on to modernised back end infrastructure, with Durham acting as the pilot site due to slippage of the single desktop project. The technical difficulties experienced as a result of this were felt at times to have marred the excellent work on all other elements of the office relocation.  This resulted in an exacting and extensive period of testing, multiple deployments and post implementation fixes which coincided with relocation of staff and functionality."

PT002,09/09/2016,Financial,WWW,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"Generous capital allocation meant that the project was able to utilise the money for late ScopeRequirements, e.g. softening.",
PT002,09/09/2016,Governance,WWW,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Internal Change Assurance - very useful tool and right level of independent assurance.,
PT002,09/09/2016,Governance,WWW,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"Transition plans developed well in advance of each move, allowing sufficient time to review and refine plans and react to late changes.",Meetings took place before each tranche move to review and refine each tranche of the overall move.
PT002,09/09/2016,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,3 different Project Managers across the lifetime of the project - right expertise available at the stages of the project,The different project leads were able to quickly get up to speed with the project with no impact on activities or deliverables.
PT002,09/09/2016,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Resourcing shortfalls on IT work stream - S&C Resourcing not responsive to this critical work stream on the project,S&C could not provide resourcing so the project utilised staff members in Operations. Absence of IT Project Plan and not having staff with expert IT knowledge.
PT002,09/09/2016,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Security Single Point of Contact - positive that we had a local designated resource but not empowered to make decisions on behalf of the business and needing to constantly refer upwards. Delay and at times inconsistency in decision making.,Reliant on local security resource who in turn was constantly having to refer upwards via internal security governance. Inconsistency in decision making and at times delayed decision making too.
PT002,09/09/2016,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Responsibility for drawing up team seating plans - could have benefitted from clearer terms of reference between project & operations.,Weekly project checkpoints provided a regular forum to discuss. Investment on project resource to work with operations to formalise team seating plans.
PT002,09/09/2016,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Readiness tracker meetings provided a good opportunity to bring everyone together but attendance at these could have been better.,Structure for these meetings was appropriate and required attendee list was felt as right. Reactive rather than proactive management of issues.
PT002,09/09/2016,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Resources being stretched too far and S&C resource backfill was not forthcoming with the project left to find its own devices to backfill resources. Shortage of test resources given the ScopeRequirements and size of the programme.,"Call upon local operations resources in some of these cases at short notice, but ultimately lacking specialist capabilities in certain areas. Lack of skilled capability/ expertise within certain areas as a result."
PT002,09/09/2016,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,More proactive management and clarity of responsibilities between project and BAU - who is responsible for what?,Was not addressed - project reacting to ad hoc ScopeRequirements due to lack of clarity.
PT002,09/09/2016,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,IT & furniture work streams closer working and communications as furniture work stream working in general isolation.,Weekly project checkpoints were in place but work stream leads simply listed activities in progress rather than collaborative working. Additional work by IT work stream to install under desk cabling.
PT002,09/09/2016,Technology,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Project dependencies not delivering on time - this project had to pick these up and then reprioritise its own resources to deliver these.,This was escalated but the project was still expected to deliver dependent changes as no other solution was achievable in the allowed timeframes. Drain on existing project resources due to unexpected prioritisation.
PT002,09/09/2016,Deployment,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Fire and Bomb Marshall leads not given the time to acquaint themselves with new building.,"Fire and Bomb marshalls were given their own familiarisation visits. These visits however were delayed numerous times due to operational needs, resulting in marshalls not given the time to acquaint themselves with layout of new building."
PT002,09/09/2016,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Team seating plans should have been frozen prior to the outset of the transition. Delayed transition exacerbated the number of team seating arrangements.,Continual rework of furniture and specialist IT needs as a result of users being moved from team to team Delayed transition exacerbated the number of team seating arrangements.
PT002,09/09/2016,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Internal formal reporting should have been suspended during transition and endorsed by senior leaders within the business.,Formal reporting was still carried out during the transition phase.  The project team were not available to project updates as they were busy dealing with transitional activities.
PT002,09/09/2016,Communications,WWW,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Sopra Steria well engaged with building designs and ScopeRequirements,

PT002,09/09/2016,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"Expert IT consultancy - CSC and Cundalls - related to building was helpful, but closer working between the two could have been helpful. Specialist IT/ Systems Business Design Lead could have been helpful.",Expectation that the project would be required to facilitate dialogue between different IT parties. Additional overhead for project and delay in decision making due to addition of an extra tier within communication channels.
PT002,09/09/2016,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Centre for Accessible Environment - could have better used recommendations from this,CAE just provided a report based on the project's building plans but the report did not carry any weight when questions were asked around accessibility in the public counter area.
PT002,09/09/2016,Commercial,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"IT Commercial Change Requests - too many, too sporadic and IT supplier constantly working at risk","IT suppliers 'drip feeding' the project with ScopeRequirements, resulting in a large number of piecemeal change requests."
PT002,09/09/2016,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Absence of technical assurance and business analysis to question and challenge IT suppliers and ability to understand complex IT technical jargon.,HOT Test team (Martin McMahon) and HOT Live Services (Abdal and Chris Cuddy) provided this on an ad hoc basis. Difficulties with deciphering and interpreting technical ScopeRequirements at times.
PT002,09/09/2016,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Fire Strategy & Risk Assessment - could have benefitted from a single Building Design Lead.,We utilised advice from multiple resources but conflicting advice provided as a result.
PT002,09/09/2016,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"Specialist chairs - unclear strategy, communications and inconsistency in applying approach","Urgent meeting held and a small team was set up to address the issue of specialist chairs.  Delay in delivery of specialist chairs and diversion of project resource to address specialist chair issues, at a time when the project could ill afford to release resource to take care of this."
PT002,09/09/2016,Schedule,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"Technical changes all last minute, no clear plan resulting in late requirement and calling on stakeholders to review and approve changes at the eleventh hour.",Technical changes were permitted to take place at the last minute and there was no cut-off date of when we would accept last minutes changes  Project/ stakeholders called to review and approve changes at the last minutes.
PT002,09/09/2016,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"Overtime many unexpected IT issues (curve balls) that were just thrown at the project and IT supplier. Need to recognise when project has gone above and beyond. Project was having to test and install new systems and infrastructure, not just ""lifting and shifting"" the existing.","The project picked up the curveballs but it meant working longer hours, particularly for resources within the IT work stream. The project worked longer hours and picked up unexpected IT issues at the last minute."
PT002,09/09/2016,Communications,WWW,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Good use of dedicated Communications resource & usage of staff on Positive Action Pathway scheme - innovative usage of resources,Allowed the different work stream to have resource who were struggling to source any from S&C Resourcing pools.
PT002,09/09/2016,Financial,WWW,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Turning the terrace areas into an accessible area for staff was a great idea.,
PT002,09/09/2016,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"Excellent, open relationship with local PCS",Monthly meeting with PCS to keep them up to date.  More straight-forward agreement on changes and ability to capitalise on good working relationship with PCS.

PT002,09/09/2016,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Familiarisation visits very helpful and supported staff with accustomising themselves with new working environment.,Dedicated resources secured by the project to deliver familiarisation visits to staff. Helped staff settle easily and allowed for less disruption and confusion when eventually moving over to their new place of work.
PT002,09/09/2016,Management,WWW,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"Good early life support - IT and BAU - in place, with targeted floorwalker resources for each area.","Early life support enabled activities leading up to transition and the transition to go smoothly, Queries/ issues were addressed and resolved quickly."

PT002,09/09/2016,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"Earlier, engagement with Durham County Council officials at a senior level to determine strategic property option preferences.","Although Mace was appointed as the building design consultant, engagement with Durham County Council had not been pitched at the right level. Freemans Reach previously assessed as too small to meet HMPO needs, and a different and less desirable option (Aykley Heads) was instead identified."
PT002,09/09/2016,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"More proactive management of local opposition MP, Roberta Blackman-Woods.","Late involvement of local opposition MP resulted in the need for intervention and stakeholder management by the (then) Immigration Minister, Mark Harper.

PT002,09/09/2016,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Home Office Shared Services - not helpful in helping the project with establishing the ScopeRequirements,The project had to continually seek advice and expertise from HOPG/ MOJ Estates. Additional overhead for project and delay in decision making due to addition of an extra tier within communication channels.

Single point of failure and delay in messages being filtered down to the rest of the team
PT002,09/09/2016,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,BAU internal communications did not consistently penetrate to all levels within operations and no feedback loop to assess how this was being received by operations.,Internal communications produced by project for various groups but no follow-up of effectiveness for communications. Weakened relations between project and operations.
PT002,09/09/2016,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Lack of agreement and constant challenge by Durham operations for passport processing productivity on Friday (day of each tranche move) and Monday (the day following move).,"No transition moves happened during Fridays, due to the demand within operations and IT 'lifting and shifting' by the IT supplier. Transition periods were short and very fast. IT & CSC became overworked during the first few days of each tranche move."
PT002,09/09/2016,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,EO Line Manager meetings very effective and should have carried on during the period of transition as a 'pulse check' on operations staff morale,"This allowed information to be proactively passed from the project to operations, allowing operations to stay in the know and prepare for any possible setbacks."
PT002,09/09/2016,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Operational Support Services not fully engaged and reliant on project to pick up what were ostensibly BAU issues. Should have been more proactive and escalated to operational leads.,"Towards the end of the project, SPOCS and other members of staff within the project began to pass on work to Estates teams with descriptions of how to complete certain tasks.  The project had to pick up where Estates teams where not wishing to handle work. SPOCs became entangled with building issues and resolving issues which  Estates should ordinarily have dealt with as part of their BAU duties."
PT002,09/09/2016,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,Not supported by Cabinet Office and HOPG/ MOJ Estates in developing Government Soft Landing metrics.,"Project was reliant on its own research and drawing on expertise from Deloitte.

Expectation for project resources to be available during the week to react to issue as well as work during weekends. Some BAU processes required attendance during a weekday, resulting in project team working excessive number of days (weekdays & weekends).","Considered tag team but would have lacked continuity.  Expectations for project team to be available during the week to react to issues as well as work during weekends. Some BAU processes required attendance during a weekday, resulting in project team working excessive number of days (weekdays & weekends)."
PT002,09/09/2016,Deployment,EBI,Project Team,,Lessons Learnt Workshop,5,,,"Air gap between Practical Completion (PC) and actually moving was helpful, but project felt bound by PC deadline due to excessive publicity and pressure to meet this deadline irrespective.",The project met the deadline for PC.

TP040A,10/01/2018,Deployment,EBI,K Tortoise,Project Team,"Test, Transition and Implementation Plan",5,,,The SLDMS team felt that at times the transition was ‘A little bit all over the place’ due to changing instructions from DAP about what could / couldn’t be processed etc.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Deployment,EBI,K Tortoise / D Hancock,Project Team,"Test, Transition and Implementation Plan",5,,,Everyone felt that it was a shame that there were not greater volumes of friendlies.,

It was challenging for the local C&E team which has responsibilities and tasks, however, Indeed it is a huge credit to this wider team that at no point did they refuse a last minute request from DAP or others.",
TP040A,10/01/2018,Communications,EBI,D Fowler,Project Team,Countdown Planner,5,,,It was acknowledged that IN part due to fact that there was a ban on discussion the change before Ministerial approval had been secured therefore the C&E Team felt were kept out of the loop in the initial stages of the project and activities being led by the SME Involving the C&E team earlier would have provided more support.  It is agreed that this is not the approach we will take for Durham with the local C&E Team engaged.,

TP040A,10/01/2018,Stakeholders,WWW,D Hancock,Project Team,Stakeholder Engagement,5,,,Commercially –CR IA etc worked very smoothly and there was good flexibility on both sides.  SSL may have been working at risk at first but that did not last long. SSL did acknowledge the need to get to position where  by unit charges are in place but that this is not possible until volumes are greater.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Stakeholders,WWW,All,Project Team,Stakeholder Engagement,5,,,Eengagement between FLDMS and SLDMS has been really professional  and both parties have been really patient despite technical limitations. The commitment from FLDMS and SLDMS has been second to none.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Stakeholders,WWW,All,Project Team,Stakeholder Engagement,5,,,Engagement between FLDMS and SLDMS has been really professional  and both parties have been really patient despite technical limitations. The commitment from FLDMS and SLDMS has been second to none and strong teamwork between SLDMS and FLDMS helped members of both teams get to know each other.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Communications,WWW,D Hancock,Project Team,Combined Communications,5,,,SSL found the communication experience much smoother as they were able to ‘steal HMPO comms with pride’.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Communications,EBI,,Project Team,Combined Communications,5,,,"All agreed that having a complete ban on communication at the beginning of the project was an almost impossible constraint – given that the project still had to progress. It would have been better to select a trusted group of ‘enablers’ ,brief them on the need for confidentiality and work with them to progress the project until such time as the project had the freedom to communicate more widely.",
TP040A,10/01/2018,Communications,EBI,,Project Team,Combined Communications,5,,,The group also felt strongly that whilst the need to control communications via TBCT was necessary and indeed value adding it did introduce further layers of review and approval both for the content of communications and their sign off. Examples occurred of those people required to sign off on communications not agreeing with each other which also introduced delay.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Assurance,EBI,,Project Team,Combined Communications,5,,,There was an issue when SLDMS had not realised until late that the pre-assurance checks were not the same of as the post assurance checks. This was caused because the design for the assurance checks had not been signed off. Hence the SLDMS were doing exactly as they were supposed to.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Communications,EBI,,Project Team,Combined Communications,5,,,All agreed that the communications associated with friendly applications was confused at times and this may have been a contributing factor in Ppts going to the wrong place / team. However it was also acknowledged that organising friendlies was a huge undertaking for the DAP BCM exacerbated by the workarounds required due to lack of address label printing.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Communications,WWW,,Project Team,Transformation Events,5,,,It was felt these supported local awareness of what the project involved. SLDMS colleagues were really grateful when the Viewpoint evets covered the DMS as it meant that they were now able to be much  more open with colleagues about the work they were doing.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Training,EBI,C Randall,Project Team,Training Plan,5,,,During the Training Planning stage there were communication issues in PPFD which did not filter from the SpoC through to PPFD Training Development caused some initial confucsion regarding CFT-delivered training.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Training,WWW,P Laws,Project Team,Training Materials,5,,,It was challenging for Andrew  Brooks  to achieve final sign-off on training because the design was changing all the time therefore the Project engaged OT regularly including regular updates and key  changes.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Training,WWW,K Tortoise,Project Team,On-the-Job' Training,5,,,The experience of ‘on the job training’ was seen as valuable for both the FLDMS and the SLDMS.,

TP040A,10/01/2018,Training,WWW,D Hancock,Project Team,Classroom Training,5,,,The CFT element of the classroom training was also held in high regard particularly the opportunity to see so many examples of damaged and tampered books.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Training,WWW,K Tortoise,Project Team,Classroom Training,5,,,The formal training was considered by everyone in the group to be excellent .  The group reported that  everyone was buzzing when they came out of the classroom.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Training,EBI,All,Project Team,Training,5,,,The only downside of training was that there was a considerable gap between training and then working with Old Passports at volume.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Governance,WWW,K Tortoise,Project Team,Policy,5,,,The DMS did not experience any issues with Policy as the role primarily follows published guidance.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Stakeholders,WWW,K Tortoise,Project Team,Procedures,5,,,Both FLDMS & SLDMS felt the guidance was good and kept up with changes in processes when they were introduced.,

TP040A,10/01/2018,Testing,WWW,D Hancock,Project Team,User Interface Testing,5,,,SSL found it beneficial to be involved in UIT early in the project.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Testing,WWW,K Tortoise,Project Team,Developer/Tester On-site,5,,,Having Richard Cook on-site supported local staff and project with expertise on the ground.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Testing,WWW,K Tortoise,Project Team,Assurance,5,,,Testing gave the opportunity to understand the process  and ensured processes and functions worked smoothly prior to go-live.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Testing,EBI,K Maxwell,Project Team,Lack of Notice,5,,,This meant that sometimes there was a lot of running around to organise things such as resources and guarding at the last minute.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Communications,WWW,D Hancock,Project Team,Wash-up Calls,5,,,The calls were useful and when key information needed to be cascaded this provided the perfect opportunity. If there was confusion this could also be cleared up.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Communications,WWW,D Hancock,Project Team,Wash-up Calls,5,,,SSL liked that both SSL and HMPO staff got together in the same room for Wash Up calls and it was suggested that this arrangement be mirrored for Durham.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Communications,EBI,K Maxwell,Project Team,Wash-up Calls,5,,,The attendees for the calls often varied there was often a need to play catch up to keep people up to speed.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Communications,EBI,K Tortoise,Project Team,Wash-up Calls,5,,,The commitment to having daily calls was time consuming but at the same time everyone on the call felt that the benefit of the calls outweighed this.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Management,WWW,D Hancock,Project Team,Issues Management,5,,,SSL felt that this ‘worked perfectly’ . They felt listened to and issues were resolved quickly.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Management,WWW,K Tortoise,Project Team,Issues Management,5,,,The DMS felt listened to and issues were resolved quickly.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Management,WWW,K Tortoise,Project Team,User Support,5,,,The DMS felt that user support was good. There was an on-site presence for support but at the same time allowed the DMS the chance to be given the space to carry out the role.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Deployment,EBI,All,Project Team,Private Beta,5,,,There would have been greater benefit in having a higher volume of friendlies bit this was blocked by the lack of address label printing functionality.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Governance,WWW,All,Project Team,SME,5,,,"All agreed that James did much more than a SME role, carrying out  BA and BCM work  and was  invaluable member of the team. James was based in Peterborough which was also a very big advantage.",
TP040A,10/01/2018,Training,WWW,All,Project Team,OTLs,5,,,OTLs only required an awareness of the new process and guidance for now and that training was not required.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,ScopeRequirements,EBI,C Randall,Project Team,SLDMS,5,,,SSL were not aware of the requirement to provide SLDMS with a terminal for the logging of assurance checks.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Resources,EBI,K Maxwell,Project Team,Contingency Planning,5,,,Careful consideration needs to be given to SLDMS resourcing so that there is contingency for leave and sickness and (longer term) when there will be a need to process Old Books after 15:00.,
TP040A,10/01/2018,Resources,EBI,K Tortoise,Project Team,Project Duration,5,,,There was misunderstanding about how long the current SLDMS would be in place. Our SLDMS colleagues had understood that they would be working on the project until February 2018 when they woud return to operations.,
TP012A,02/06/2017,Assurance,EBI,Project Team,Operations Implementation Project (OIPT),After first site assurance visits - May '17,5,,,It was difficult for the project team to compile and create site assurance reports. Reports were difficult to write as we were drawing information from various sources.,"Low IMPACT - the assurance reports were still created to projected timescales.  Although reports were written on time, it would have been easier to have a pre-agreed process for recording info from the visits, and the content of the visits themselves."
TP012A,02/06/2017,Governance,WWW,Project Team,OIPT,,5,,,The only other thing I can think of at the moment is around discussions we had last week with Rachel and Michelle and who is accountable for ensuring the outcomes of the reports are actioned and timelines put in place.  We can discuss on our call in more detail this week.,
TP012A,05/06/2017,Governance,EBI,Project Team,OIPT,,5,,,"It would have been easier for all sites to work to the same style of Project Plan/ 90 day plan/ TIP from the outset of the project. A template could have been pre-defined and agreed upon, and updated in real time throughout.","Because there was not a consistent Project Plan format, this meant having to amalgamate various plans in different guises into one consistent plan, which took time and effort. Sites had already grown accustomed to the plans they were using."
TP012A,05/06/2017,Financial,EBI,Project Team,OIPT,,5,,,"The Benefits agreed by the SRO at the start of the project should have been wholly measurable, and we should have been continually measuring against them as activity progressed.","Significant IMPACT - A week's worth of activity was lost due to focussing on the Benefits piece, which delayed certain critical tasks.  Without measuring benefits all the way through the project, there came a week long slog in early June whereby all members of ETP and OIPT were This caused a delay in all other activity, including in a whole week's delay in ETP's optimistic 12 week plan for the CRST function."
TP014,21/02/2019,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Implementation and Transition. Closure,5,,,Early sight of CR1780 would have been advantageous. The document clearly sets out Sopra Steria's expectations from the project,It took time to fully understand Sopra Steria's view of the Overseas project. Conversations with the Sopra Steria and commercial gleaned this information over time to write an acceptable CR to produce the IA. All staff on same page
TP014,21/02/2019,Testing,EBI,Project Team,,Define Solution,5,,,Sufficient time to conduct a UAT and Full testing,Phase 3 of the project had a short time scale in which to deliver. This meant that the usual project management cycle was not followed. We started to move towards delivery without fully understanding how we would achieve the outcome and what was possible. . Lack of understanding led to an unreralistic expectation of what could be achieved and in what time scale.  Thorough testing  and arranging UAT staff were very tight timescales
TP014,21/02/2019,ScopeRequirements,WWW,Project Team,,Test and Acceptance,5,,,Written & Verbal Communications,Regular short meetings worked well

TP014,21/02/2019,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Build Solution,5,,,A number of changes to design had to be made.,"This impacted on communication to users, which had to be regualrly updated and changed.  Short timescale to Go Live/ Phase 3 work overlapped with Christmas holidays  Could cause confusion to users."
TP014,21/02/2019,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Implementation and Transition. Closure,5,,,Communications were reviewed promptly by Senior Communications Manager,The review of messaging to the customer took place via a powerpoint presentation rather than lengthy emails back and forth  Review of comms completed in 2hours.
TP014,21/02/2019,Schedule,EBI,Project Team,,Implementation and Transition. Closure,5,,,change delivered in a very short space of time,Tight deadline for go live  caused presure on other work remits.
TP014,21/02/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Test and Acceptance,5,,,change delivered in a very short space of time - lacked resource planning,impacted other QAT teams as resources had to be pulled at short notice.
TP014,21/02/2019,Communications,WWW,Project Team,,Implementation and Transition. Closure,5,,,Stakeholder call/engagement were good.,quick turnaround
TP014,21/02/2019,Schedule,EBI,Project Team,,Implementation and Transition. Closure,5,,,challenging timelines,"short go live date no time to resolve issues with LSR team, had to find quick workarounds"

TP014,21/02/2019,Communications,WWW,Project Team,,Implementation and Transition. Closure,5,,,Approach was right,no issues
TP014,21/02/2019,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,Implementation and Transition. Closure,5,,,worked well with teams,calls useful to understand who the stakeholders were.
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,DNA Pilot 1,5,,,There were initial reliability and usability issues for customers leading to customer contact with Liverpool Sub Risk Team,Negative Impact - VFS installed IT releases to resolve reliability and issued customers with a users guide for the portal. This has resulted in a reduction of contact.
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,DNA Pilot 1,5,,,As a result of the above customers were trying to contact VFS by e-mail. Also general e-mail enquires from VFS take up to a day to receive a response. This lead to customer contact with Liverpool Sub Risk Team that was avoidable and a poorer customer experience.,Negative Impact - VFS are seeking to improve their monitoring of e-mails in general. Resolutions put in place for the above have also resulted in less contact for the Sub Risk team and an improved customer experience
TP045,26/03/2018,Deployment,WWW,Project Team,,DNA Pilot 1,5,,,Clear well documented work,Positive Impact - Easy for staff and customers to follow what should happen and when with new process
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,DNA Pilot 1,5,,,Visibility of VFS VACs process causing concern re integrity of process,Negative impact - Requirement to have a security report process needs to be followed up to provide reassurance
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,DNA Pilot 1,5,,,Lack of visibility of what UKVI will check leading to concerns around security,Negative impact - No visibility of what we want UKVI to check when they complete spot checks
TP045,26/03/2018,Governance,WWW,Project Team,,DNA Pilot 1,5,,,Good level of engagement,Positive impact - Engagement with business and stakeholders was felt to be good with action taken to address concerns. Up front sessions were seen as the reason for building up the good relationship with Liverpool Sub Risk Team and SLT
TP045,26/03/2018,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,DNA Pilot 1,5,,,Lack of clarity around roles and responsibilities for business and project when doing the Issues lead to confusion and uncertainty at times,Negative Impact - Some of the issues went unresolved for longer than required and some confusion around what should and should not be reported and how often.
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,DNA Pilot 1,5,,,Customer chase up e-mails required responses which could have been dealt with had an auto response been in place without staff intervention,"Negative Impact - Staff had to send a standard response pointing customer towards VFS taking up time, adding the auto response later on freed up staff time"
TP045,26/03/2018,Communications,WWW,Project Team,,DNA Pilot 1,5,,,Communications were delivered in a clear fashion and the appropriate time in the pilot,Positive impact - customers and staff were kept well informed which ensured good levels of compliance with new process and that staff were kept informed and engaged.
TP045,26/03/2018,Communications,WWW,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,"Importance of targeted and clear, consistent communications highlighted",Impact - In the early stages of the project rumours circulated around HMPO leaving and that it was the start of something wider than just HMPO. Need to take into account the people sensitivities in generic communications such as newsletters.  Benefit - Lessons were learned and communications are targeted at key stakeholders to ensure they are aware of what the plans for the closure of the OCFN network and repatriation of the overseas work. A recent good example is the delivery of a PowerPoint presentation to staff in Belfast which was extremely well received.
TP045,26/03/2018,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,Built and maintained good relationships across the various project work streams,"Benefit - the project and the wider stakeholders have built good, mutually beneficial working relationships. This is partly due to appropriate display of behaviours whilst engaging."
TP045,26/03/2018,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,HMPO engagement with FCO had to be improved and getting the right contacts proved challenging,"Impact - Difficulties were experienced in making the right contacts in the FCO. It has since been agreed that all engagement with FCO should be via Andrea Newsome, Head of International Customer Experience; Andrea is a single point of contact for FCO and is aware of the sensitivities surrounding communications. (Should be FCO Head of Mission first). The roles were unclear between Consular Services v Head of Mission. Clear milestones are needed with an end date, Management visits to CFCs, joint planning would have helped."
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,WWW,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,Template developed for closure of offices,Benefit - A template was developed to detail all the actions involved in closing an office; it proved to be a useful tool. It was updated after lessons learned from early closures to improve the document further.
TP045,26/03/2018,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,Governance in the early stages of the project needed to improve,Impact - In the early stages of the HMPO project governance was not in place as it should have been. E.g. risks and issues were not updated  Benefit - A change of Project Manager and additional staff joining the project facilitated better governance and the project has followed HMPO project disciplines for some time now.
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,WWW,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,WIP close down ahead of closure,Benefit - Establishing plans to reduce the work in progress (WIP) worked well; the number of cases in the offices that are closing have been monitored closely and the wip has reduced significantly.
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,WWW,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,Clear visibility of design of replacement solutions,"Benefit - The design of the new processes have been documented and shared with stakeholders in a timely manner including BDA, e.g. high level process maps, ScopeRequirements approved by appropriate parties."
TP045,26/03/2018,Deployment,WWW,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,APC staff concerns were recognised and interventions implemented to address them,Impact - Concerns were expressed that Operations staff were nervous about the implementation of the new processes Benefit - The project was able to implement interventions at an early stage which has helped build confidence. Different team needed different levels of intervention and it was important to recognise this.
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,The date confirmed for office closure were geared to CFO end dates,Impact - The dates for closure were geared to CFO end dates and were not shared with community
TP045,26/03/2018,Deployment,EBI,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,Evidence of success of closure,Impact – Success factors need to be agreed i.e. the measures/indicators to demonstrate e.g. OVS intake; % interventions  NB Cost/benefit statement [Tina]; Min Success measures [Tina]
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,Complexity of overseas work underestimated,Impact/Benefit - Important to listen to and hear the issues being raised by OCFN team
TP045,26/03/2018,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,Engagement with locally engaged staff,
TP045,26/03/2018,Deployment,EBI,Project Team,,Islamabad Closure,5,,,Behaviour v Message,Impact - Behaviour – cases still coming across to the OCFN teams but their offices were closing and trying to get the wip down. ; team on ground still see work coming in? (Did Belfast send something overseas to Islamabad) Staff looked at big events and the changing approach but  didn’t believe it would happen
TP045,26/03/2018,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,DNA Pilot,5,,,HMPO DNA account lead leaving TLS. No contingency in place.,Delay in starting the pilot/testing.
TP045,26/03/2018,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,DNA BAU,5,,,DNA BAU calls with TLS often did not have both Fares and Ian Cartlidge on the same call.,Without representatives from both commercial and operations within TLS on teleconference calls during procurement and implementation there were delays in progress as immediate responses from the relevant area were not available.
TP045,26/03/2018,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,DNA BAU,5,,,A case requires collaboration between TLS and VFS because applicant/parents reside in countries not covered entirely by 1 supplier. Positive initial communications between suppliers.,Positive establishment of communications between TLS and VFS  to work together after request came through that involved cross coverage.
TP045,26/03/2018,Deployment,WWW,Project Team,,DNA BAU,5,,,The project held briefings with the staff directly affected by the implementation of new DNA process,Positive feedback received from teams regarding the quality of the briefings. Project staff had comprehensive knowledge of topic and were able to resolve queries. Direct interaction with staff who will be using new process helped enable smooth transition.
TP045,26/03/2018,Deployment,WWW,Project Team,,DNA BAU,5,,,Regular wash-up calls held between project and the teams who are using the new DNA process.,Evidence  that early post go live issues will be dealt with as part of project's  implementation approach rather than being left for Operations post handover gave Operational staff confidence and reassurance in the project and what was being delivered. Helps to establish/maintain positive reputation for S
TP045,26/03/2018,Deployment,WWW,Project Team,,DNA BAU,5,,,Acknowledgement by SMT stakeholder of positive behaviours  and good quality output by project team,Project complimented on its Identification of correct stakeholders. Resulting in it being much easier for other stakeholders to learn what was happening but also gave reassurance that we knew what we were doing and were asking the right people.
TP045,26/03/2018,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Project,5,,,Communication with external stakeholder was originally through proxy. No assurance message had been delivered and interpreted correctly,External comms ineffective. Potential damage to stakeholder relationship.
TP045,26/03/2018,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Project,5,,,Access to specific stakeholders from the business was limited by PM,Restricted communication with key stakeholder meant access to required information early in project was very difficult and was an unnecessary blocker.  Hard to find right person to get detailed information from BA perspective
TP045,26/03/2018,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Project,5,,,Communication of instructions about which applications should be held during OCFN site closure and DNA transition only communicated to senior stakeholders.,"Uncertainty from Substantial Teams and CFT around pausing the referral of some applications during OCFN closures and DNA transition. Unclear which applications were being 'kept back', which were still being referred to OCFN and which were being dealt with by sub. teams."
TP045,26/03/2018,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Document Verification,5,,,Infrequency of communications leading up to go-live of Document verification,Uncertainty from staff in delivery of suitable solution. Acknowledged that this was in part due to poor previous experiences from another project..
TP045,26/03/2018,Deployment,WWW,Project Team,,Document Verification,5,,,The project held briefings with the staff directly affected by the implementation of new DV process,Positive feedback received from teams regarding the quality of the briefings. Project staff had comprehensive knowledge of topic and were able to resolve queries. Direct interaction with staff who will be using new process helped enable smooth transition.
TP045,26/03/2018,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Project,5,,,CAM roadmap not apparent until late on in project.,"Uncertainty around prioritisation and communication for CAMS. High number of CAMS in short space of time with short notice due to lack of CAM organisation (project team, not CAT)"
TP045,26/03/2018,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Project,5,,,Project had many worksteams but status of workstreams and what each member of team was working on not shared.,"Potential duplication of work between worksteams, especially with some staff working on more than one. Possibility for compartmentalised/silo'd approach."
TP045,26/03/2018,Governance,WWW,Project Team,,Project,5,,,Observation from stakeholders,Good internal relationship within project for new joiner
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Project,5,,,Information was requested from overseas sources within HMPO. In some instances this information was not an accurate picture of how a process or procedure should be done properly but instead an opinion,check and cross check info as often ends up as opinion rather than fact/correct process.
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,WWW,Project Team,,DNA,5,,,The Liverpool sub risk team challenged assumptions during design and then go-live proposals as well as the pilot outcomes.,Clearer design of pilot and resolution of issues prior to go-live.
TP045,26/03/2018,Financial,EBI,Project Team,,DNA,5,,,Loss of initial point of contact meant a lack of ownership from HO Commercial Team until issue escalated,Delay in the procurement process and lack of support when challenge received from a potential supplier of DNA testing
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Project,5,,,Early in project there was no documented project plan.,Lack of a detailed plan from PM caused conflicts with the delivery of change activity and clarity of messaging for stakeholders.
TP045,26/03/2018,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Project,5,,,Poor comms between previous PM and PD,PM lack of engagement with PD had detrimental effect on messaging to Mission Board and with other senior management. Also caused issues within project team.
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Project,5,,,Uncertainty around who owned which stakeholder relationships,"In the early stages of the project the PM ""owned"" certain stakeholders at the expense of the rest of the team. In addition some internal stakeholders owned external stakeholders thus building in a layer of complexity that was not helpful to good communication and engagement."
TP045,26/03/2018,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,Project,5,,,"Positive responses / behaviours from senior stakeholders,",Project delivered various workstraems with minimum impact on the business while meeting the needs of stakeholders. Project also had a clear view of what was required and expected. Problem resolution was a collaborative effort.
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Project,5,,,should have tacked tp020 differently.,Disjointed approach and no single view of repatriation of international
TP045,26/03/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Project,5,,,Workstreams associated with the closure of OCFN and repatriation were not delivered within 1 project.,"Confusion with stakeholders and differing delivery approach, engagement and response to stakeholder concerns"
TP045,26/03/2018,BAU,WWW,Project Team,,DNA BAU,5,,,"Surrogacy workshop by ALI - helped reassure, not really in project ScopeRequirements but reinforced relationship",Increased understanding for staff and clear guidance produced
TP045,26/03/2018,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Project,5,,,"High volume of emails when returning from leave,",Time taken to get back up to speed with where project was
TP061,15/03/2019,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,The project could have been even better if Slack conversations were more limited and the majority of conversation took place in email. Despite this I feel that for the most part communication has been open and clear and individuals have challenged when any aspect of the project has been confusing.,"Benefit:  for the most part communication has been open and clear and individuals have challenged when any aspect of the project has been confusing. * It ensured that we constructed and maintained a shared understanding of what the business and our customers are asking for, what we are building, and what  Impact:  It took time to resolve problems that we had on Slack."
TP061,16/03/2019,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,Decision making – It has felt like many of the conversations project had or work project did petered out without a clear resolution or next steps.,Impact: Lack of agreed conclusions for work involving team members would make recording decisions on Decisions Log easier.
TP061,17/03/2019,Governance,WWW,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,"Slack was a great tool to use to communicate as a team, as a tool for sharing few key and/or urgent messages/short notes between team members. As project moved continued to grow however, more and more began getting shared on Slack.  As contractors are generally not able to readily access the U: Drive access, the U: Drive is not the best medium for a mixed team.","Benefit:  It was a good way of keeping in touch with the team and sharing opinions. Good communication tool for general comms as an accessible platform for both HMPO and contractors. Benefit: conversations were threaded and easy to find. Benefit: Instant response received from message recipients  Impact: It became difficult to find previous conversations or even decide which channel a message should be sent in as project became bigger and more channels were created. After a few months, we hit the message limit meaning that we couldn’t use Slack’s search feature either."
TP061,18/03/2019,Resources,WWW,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,"Forming and Storming - One thing which went well is that project team quickly began to understand each other’s roles and responsibility, thanks in part to an explanation from Nat Percival in one of earlier team meetings. This meant that work was directed to the right place first time and very little time was spent arguing about who should do what. There was and is a good level of mutual trust and respect within the team to carry out each other’s work quickly, effectively and to a high standard.","Benefit: This meant that work was directed to the right place first time and very little time was spent arguing about who should do what. There was and is a good level of mutual trust and respect within the team to carry out each other’s work quickly, effectively and to a high standard."
TP061,18/03/2019,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,More effective supplier governance for the technical and project management aspects of the plan were established.,Impact: The contract sign-off will not be continuously delayed.
TP061,18/03/2019,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,"All business ScopeRequirements were captured at design stage. This means, SABS ScopeRequirements were produced some time before the project really got going.",Impact: M.I Design ScopeRequirements would not have been discussed during delivery.  Impact: This meant there had been various changes in personnel and some of the understanding of the thought process behind them had been lost.
TP061,18/03/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,Recruitment management deployed more rigour in ensuring the right skill-set resources were recruited.,Impact: No delay in delivery of front-end development sprints.
TP061,18/03/2019,Resources,WWW,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,Project resource dedicated to DDaT service management ScopeRequirements.,AIS Criteria identified and worked through to obtain necessary information from supplier/stakeholders.
TP061,18/03/2019,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,There was early engagement with the Service Management team and vice versa.  Supplier service information input into Service Delivery Pack (SDP).,Benefit: Good collaboration with supplier to ensure the relevant service details were obtained.
TP061,20/03/2019,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,"Back End had been developed in an Agile manner, with HMPO able to test each sprint.","Impact: Project raised a lot of defects after the supplier had delivered. Many defects have been slow to fix as supplier team has been disbanded prematurely, and some will be costly to fix as supplier disputes project's expectations of ScopeRequirements."
TP061,20/03/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,No Interaction Designer on project team,Impact: Not having an interaction designer meant we struggled to demonstrate our progress to stakeholders. An interaction designer could have created a clickable prototype for demonstrations and testing.
TP061,20/03/2019,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,Team spread widely across country,"Impact: Having team members spread across the country made communications difficult, particularly without video conferencing facilities"
TP061,20/03/2019,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,Limited discovery,Impact: The official discovery missed important business ScopeRequirements and user stories. The project team carried out a limited discovery while developing and testing an alpha prototype to attempt to mitigate this shortcoming.
TP061,20/03/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,Some members of the team were new to agile methods.,Impact: Lack of experience with agile meant the team did not work as effectively as it could have.
TP061,20/03/2019,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,No clickable prototype allowing testing in a lab environment (due to front end developer leaving and not replaced),"Impact: Project had to go straight to code which is a risk, if usability testing found any issues it would have cost HMPO more to fix those in the final product than the prototype."
TP061,20/03/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,Development bottle neck due to 2 x developers leaving and posts being vacant.  In house developers had been recruited earlier in project lifecycle.,Impact: Fewer staff to create service meant that timescales slipped and milestones were not reached. Impact: Test team could not test the API as there was no front end screens to test it through.
TP061,20/03/2019,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,"Use of the U:/drive and Confluence was problematic for some staff. Not everyone could access U:/drive. Some files were too large to email to self, to save on U:/drive. Files were sometimes too big for Confluence.",Impact: Project documentation was split between different repositories and staff had difficulty accessing drives.
TP061,20/03/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,Lack of tech solutions to support remove working,"Impact: The team were spread across the country and could only reliably communicate by teleconference. For user research, this meant separate slides needed to be produced to speak through on the phone so that findings could be conveyed more visually."
TP061,20/03/2019,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,Lack of Show and Tells with stakeholders,Impact: Stakeholders only heard about project updates via a teleconference call. Show and Tells with stakeholders viewing the team's work would have allowed more discussion around meeting business needs and ensuring the service met stakeholders' needs.
TP061,20/03/2019,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,Unclear ScopeRequirements,Impact: The supplier built based off ScopeRequirements that were vague and the Admin UI delivered had many usability issues.
TP061,20/03/2019,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,New ScopeRequirements being surfaced- ScopeRequirements creep,"Impact: New ScopeRequirements were found through business analysis and user research, significantly impacting project ScopeRequirements."
TP061,20/03/2019,Governance,WWW,Project Team,,LL Workshop,5,,,"Empowered team. Retrospectives were valuable and the team felt empowered to question and suggest changes to working processes, which evolved over tie.  Most Retros were arranged as face-to-face meetings even though the project team was geographically dispersed.",Impact: the team changed working processes and evolved. People felt confident to speak up and work through issues. Strong working relationships were formed.
TP028,08/12/2017,Estates,WWW,Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,We managed to find some of the laptops stated in the asset register.,This situation should not have arisen in the first place and was a result of poor asset management.
TP028,08/12/2017,Estates,WWW,Supplier,,LL Workshop,6,,,As assets were identified in Heywood and disposed of the CMBD asset list was updated.,This situation should not have arisen in the first place and was a result of poor asset management.
TP028,08/12/2017,Communications,EBI,Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,Lack of communications between project and the closed flexi sites.,Offices had already transported or re-assigned laptops without informing the project or Supplier.
TP028,08/12/2017,Communications,EBI,Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,Lack of communications between project and the closed flexi sites.,Assets marked for the attention of the supplier field engineers were not clearly labelled as to what project they belonged to.
TP028,08/12/2017,Estates,EBI,Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,No basic asset management undertaken by the supplier when assets arrived at Heywood.,Engineers failed to inform the supplier asset management about the movement of laptops and therefore the CMDB was not updated.
TP028,08/12/2017,Communications,EBI,Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,The supplier PM should have confirmed the laptops were all available for destruction when the destruction took place this was a complete waste of time and money.,"The project assumed that the supplier PM and field engineers would have communicated as to the whereabouts of the assets in Charles House. This did not occur, and as such the first destruction was a waste of time and money"
TP028,08/12/2017,Governance,EBI,Supplier,,LL Workshop,6,,,There was no notification of the laptops being dropped off in Heywood or where they were stored.,This is the fault of failure to follow the agreed asset management processes by the supplier.
TP028,08/12/2017,Assurance,EBI,HMPO Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,The supplier PM should provide assurance that all assets have been reconciled and their location confirmed before any destruction takes place.,
TP028,08/12/2017,Governance,EBI,HMPO Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,The Project should have performed their asset confirmation with the offices at an earlier stage.,
TP028,08/12/2017,Governance,EBI,HMPO Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,I would let the supplier take total charge of future projects when it comes to the transportation and collection of assets from sites. We exposed our own poor asset management which is not a criticism of the project but a consequence of a historical failure by the supplier in terms of asset management.,
TP028,08/12/2017,Stakeholders,EBI,HMPO Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,Our information is only as good as that supplied by the supplier. What this project clearly illustrated is that there are major flaws in the current asset management process between HMPO and the supplier.,
TP028,08/12/2017,Communications,WWW,Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,Excellent communication between the project and Security. Regular updates received and all request for information promptly answered,
TP028,08/12/2017,Stakeholders,WWW,Supplier,,LL Workshop,6,,,Once the assets had reached Heywood and been located the disposal was carried out effectively and in an auditable manner.,Unfortunately it took a long time to get to this point. The only reason this was possible was due to a group of HMPO employees travelling to Charles House to sort out the poor asset management of the supplier.   This group went through every HMPO asset present in G27 for recording purposes; however this should not have been necessary if the supplier stored assets in a proper manner.
TP028,08/12/2017,Stakeholders,EBI,Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,The supplier should have taken control of the decommissioning side of the project on reflection. We set ourselves up for a fall.,"Whilst letting the supplier take total control of future decommissioning projects would be one solution,  the supplier have not proven themselves to be capable of following the agreed asset management processes either.  In terms of the decommissioning side of this project the supplier did take full control in the sense that the destruction was organised by the the supplier PM with support from the supplier IA."
TP028,08/12/2017,Estates,EBI,Supplier,,LL Workshop,6,,,"There was no proper tracking of many of the assets involved.  In many cases there was no asset number in the original register provided by HMPO and in some other cases the asset numbers involved were changed as the project progressed.  Therefore, although the disposal processes were good it was not possible to be certain that the assets dealt with were the correct ones.","There was no proper tracking of many of the assets involved.

TP028,08/12/2017,Assurance,EBI,Supplier,,LL Workshop,6,,,"Additionally, the fact that the closure process pre-dated the CR and the subsequent reliance on photographic evidence did not work too well.  In future, if photographic evidence is to be used ways have to be found to demonstrate that the coverage of the space is continuous, and photographs have to be provided of the inside of all cupboards and drawers.",

TP028,08/12/2017,Communications,WWW,Supplier,,LL Workshop,6,,,Communication between HMPO and the supplier’s PM was good.,"Communication was good between HMPO and the supplier PM’s, however the issues were caused by internal the supplier communication."
TP028,08/12/2017,Governance,EBI,Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,Bailey Steel would have benefitted with some more support from the project team.,
TP028,08/12/2017,Governance,EBI,Supplier,,LL Workshop,6,,,The supplier’s field support person was not notified in advance that they were to receive Flexi site laptops. The supplier’s PM was notified after the delivery of the laptops.,This was an issue created by the lack of asset management instruction and therefore Systems teams sent back the laptops at random. The supplier field support did not update the CMDB upon obtaining the laptops.
TP028,08/12/2017,Governance,EBI,Supplier,,LL Workshop,6,,,There was not a smooth hand over from Steve Edwards to Bailey Steel,Steve Edwards and Bailey Steel were not employed by HMPO at the same time. There was very little work done on the flexi site project until Bailey Steel began to PM.
TP028,08/12/2017,Communications,WWW,HMPO Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,The project engaged all the relevant HMPO stakeholders regularly. This ensured all areas were covered whenever you engaged the supplier,Whenever calls were organised with the supplier the project endeavoured to have a representative from all stakeholder groups. This helped immensely with resolving issues and should be adopted for the future.
TP028,08/12/2017,Governance,WWW,Supplier,,LL Workshop,6,,,"To save HMPO money, the costs and effort for disposing of the assets that missed the original disposal date will be included in the larger project CR1462. This has removed the need to resources needing to be present whilst only 14 assets are disposed of.","Whilst this eventually did happen this was identified at a very early stage in the project. The supplier seemed reluctant to move forward with this until pressure was applied from HMPO Asset Management, Security and the project team."
TP028,08/12/2017,Stakeholders,EBI,Security,,LL Workshop,6,,,Arranged a face-to-face meeting with the supplier PM and the supplier security and HMPO Security.  We could have discussed the decommissioning options in more depth and placed actions on the supplier.,This would have helped the process and this will be taken into account when dealing with the supplier in future projects.
TP028,08/12/2017,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Supplier,,LL Workshop,6,,,Once the project started and it was identified that the Flexi sites were already closed. A Project Change Note should have been written to requote and ScopeRequirements the project with change HMPO ScopeRequirements to just dispose of HMPO identified assets. Removing the supplier from HMPO internal asset movements would have saved the project both time and effort.,The PCN route was explored earlier in the project but it was decided that this was not the best route to close the project.  Even though the HMPO ScopeRequirements changed after the CR was approved the IA still covered what the project needed the supplier to do. The PCN would have made this clear but the project does not think this would have saved neither time nor effort.

TP091,05/10/2018,Schedule,EBI,Shirley Towner,PM,LL Workshop,5,,,"The project was handed over from the design team with a very tight deadline to deliver. Initial deadline was September/October 2018. Once speaking to suppliers and operations, project realised that the old barcodes would remain in stock until December/January.","The project anticipated tight deadlines however the old barcodes were still in stock until December/January, giving the project more time to deliver effectively."
TP091,08/10/2019,Communications,WWW,Andrea McAleese,TBCT,LL Workshop,5,,,TBCT were regularly engaged and updated. Count down planner worked very on the regular calls which were also engaging and comprehensive.,Regular engagement with stakeholders provided early sight of issues and confidence in running of the project.
TP091,10/10/2018,Stakeholders,EBI,Pauline Quinn,,LL Workshop,5,,,The correct barcode specification took a while to sort out as the supplier changed during the life of the project.,Barcodes with incorrect specification were ordered a number of times.

TP081a,27/03/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,Lack of IT expert input at the initiation.,Caused the IT link development to be pro-longed & missed the DXC requirement.
TP081a,27/03/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,CTC requirement for IM staff.,"The lead-up to migration required box building at Fengate & IM had staff DBS cleared & their own security level, but not full Home Office level. Lost a bit of time in preparing for migration."
TP081a,27/03/2019,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,Lack of design analysis.,The ScopeRequirements of the IT link was not appreciated (cost or timescale).
TP081a,27/03/2019,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,Not initially appreciated that the solution was to utilise the existing contract solution (Fujitsu link) that involved DXC & separate testing upgrades.,"This caused the migration date to be delayed, whilst the IT link was developed (expanded) to include DXC activities within the UKVI solution."
TP081a,27/03/2019,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,DDaT & HMPO Operations worked well together.,"Once the solution was identified, the collaborative working was excellent to achieve success."
TP081a,27/03/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,The supplier should have had experienced resource to ScopeRequirements the activities.,"Migration took longer than anticipated due to the height of the racking & the records compacted, adding circa 15% to the volume."
TP081a,27/03/2019,Deployment,WWW,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,Fengate staff did a fantastic job in supporting the migration.,"The two key team members went beyond their day job to support, assist & advise, including spending time building boxes (Sally)."
TP081a,27/03/2019,Resources,WWW,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,Iron Mountain resource at Fengate.,It was noted that the team were professional & ensured that everything was cleared & cleaned up.
TP081a,27/03/2019,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,Iron Mountain underestimated the volume to be migrated by c15%,The migration period took longer than initially ScopeRequirementsd.
TP081a,27/03/2019,Governance,WWW,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,There was flexibility in the collaborative working.,This was vital in enabling flexibility to prioritise the migration & switch to migrate key Countries ahead of dormant files.
TP081a,27/03/2019,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,Out of office message on old process.,"The team at Fengate initiated a message to Examiners et al that once live, if sent incorrectly to old HMPO email, the reply would provide new instruction on the Supplier email."
TP081a,27/03/2019,Commercial,EBI,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,Supplier supply chain failure.,Iron Mountain's supplier provided the lids to the boxes late & which caused some lost time.
TP081a,27/03/2019,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,Exceptional contribution by the Fengate team.,Showed tremendous flexibility & willingness to support the migration.

TP081a,27/03/2019,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Workshop,5,,,Senior stakeholders to be engaged earlier on apparent issues.,Earlier engagement may have been able to rectify some of the issues by actively engaging the senior stakeholders.
TP007D,10/05/2019,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,All business ScopeRequirements were captured the previous year which was some time before the project really got going.,Impact:  The ScopeRequirements had become superceeded by changes in some business areas and HMPO ScopeRequirements were subsidiary to those of UKVI as the primary customer and procurer/manager of the contract.  This meant changes to the product design have been driven by UKVI and HMPO needed to address their ScopeRequirements within the overall design considerations of utilising a shared service.  Benefit UKVI are paying for the monthly licence and service support costs through the supplier contract providing a value for money service for HMPO and ensuring International interviews are delivered over a single service for HMPO and UKVI.
TP007D,10/05/2019,Communications,WWW,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,Small close knit project team,"Benefit  Communications very direct and more streamlined between project members, leading to timely effective discussions and speedier decisionmaking"
TP007D,10/05/2019,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,HMPO are the 'secondary' customer with UKVI being the main customer as they procured and manage the contract with Flabba,"Impact The Flabba Service includes a number of functions suited to UKVI ScopeRequirements and  UKVI are driving further changes to the Flabba Service to suit their needs. This means there are elements which are not needed for current HMPO business processes such as set questions, ability to upload documents, dashboad sections, audio transcription etc."
TP007D,10/05/2019,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,"Counter Fraud ScopeRequirements to be provided with Video Interview connectivity in additonal sites, Glasgow, Durham, London and Liverpool were under the 'small projects' team in a separate portfolio",Impact There was some duplication of effort and communications to understand the ScopeRequirements and how this fitted with the delivery plans for Flabba
TP007D,10/05/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,The ScopeRequirements of the project expanded over time to include procurement of broadband lines for CFT and development of an In House build to support secure access to the web based Flabba Service as well as Skype,Impact The workload and complexity of the project increased however the allocated resources did not
TP007D,10/05/2019,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,The residual work from the closed Domestic VIS project to handover the build and support to BAU had been completed earlier,Impact The International project team were sidetracked by supporting issues arising such as the urgent deployment of the 1709 build to free up TDA/Service support resources to work on the International build
TP007D,10/05/2019,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,Opportunity to 'show and tell' the updated build to security at a face to face session,Benefit This made it much easier for them to understand how the new build differed from the previous one which made for a much smoother process in obtaining their sign off.
TP007D,10/05/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,Early engagement with CBT and Interview teams to show them the Flabba platform and screens and get their feedback to inform adjustments and understand process impacts to suit HMPO ScopeRequirements.,Impact Key operations teams were able to see the new system including using the screens relevant to their roles   Benefit This work enabled the users to try out early versons of training material and provide feedback too inform final versions and deployment plans
TP007D,10/05/2019,Governance,WWW,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,Being able to build on the work done on the Service Support Wrapper and High Level Design document produced for Domestic VIS,Benefit Using documentation from an earlier and very similar project reduced the work needed to produce corresponding document for International VIS
TP007D,10/05/2019,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,There was early engagement with the Service Management teams and vice versa.  Supplier service information input into Service Delivery Pack (SDP).,"Benefit: Good collaboration with internal DSST, TDA, HMPO Service Architect and HoDdat ensured the relevant service details were obtained and included in the Service Design Pack and High Level Design document."
TP007D,10/05/2019,Deployment,EBI,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,Delay in installation of Broadband line for CFT Liverpool,Impact CFT are unable to conduct international interviews over the new platform Flabba till they have the broadband installed
TP007D,10/05/2019,Governance,WWW,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,CFT locations provided with Skype connectivity as an interim arrangement till Flabba Go-Live,Benefit  Acknowledging delays with the transition to Flabba and exploring the viability of providing interim connectivity and rquipment to support Skype enabled CFT colleagues to connect from their home locations rather than travelling to the video hub in Sheffield or moving work around
TP007D,10/05/2019,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,Show and Tell sessions with key stakeholders,Benefit This made it much easier for Operations colleagues and Service Managers to see what the new service looked like and understand the impacts for their teams especially any changes to the time required to undertake key tasks and potential resource implications.
TP007D,10/05/2019,Stakeholders,WWW,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,Fortnightly stakeholder calls throughout the project,Benefit This promoted early engagement with stakeholders and provided a regular forum for them to obtain updates and raised issues/concerns directly with the project.  A summary of each call was emailed to all stakeholders to ensure absent colleagues also had up to date information
TP007D,10/05/2019,ScopeRequirements,WWW,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,UKVI started conducting interviews on Flabba ahead of HMPO,Benefit UKVI identified teething issues with the new system and connectivity issues with VACs which they worked with the suppliers to address without any impacts to HMPO interviews which were maintained on Skype
TP007D,10/05/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,International In House build tested by HMPO DSST,"Impact This was a first for DSST and the project to conduct this work without assistance from an experienced project 'test resource' providing a strong learning curve, a residual issue with the webcam not working over Flabba was only identified after deployment of the build. Perhaps this could have been identified during test if the team had been more experienced in testing activity."
TP007D,10/05/2019,ScopeRequirements,WWW,Project Team,,Project Calls,5,,,Belfast desktops moved to spare capacity on the Domestic VIS Broadband line in May 2018,Benefit This enabled HMPO to maintain an International Interview Service over Skype when the broadband service provided by Ajilon ceased when the contract ended on 23rd May 2018.  This came at nil cost to HMPO as the Domestic VIS broadband was already in place and had sufficient space capacity to take the International interviews
TP007D,24/05/2019,Commercial,EBI,HMPO Commercial,,Project Calls,5,,,HMPO were unaware the broadband supplier was contracting out the end part of the broadband supply which linked to the HMPO site.,Impact This created delays as the first supplier they choose had no exisiting lines to the building which required considerable disruption to the business and area outside the building to install.  The landlord was not agreeable to this meaning a new order was placed with another supplier who had a 60 day SLA.
TP007D,05/07/2019,Stakeholders,WWW,HMPO Operations Service Managers,,Project Calls,5,,,"The project team recognised that the introduction of Flabba inputs on two of the Service Lines – International and UK Assisted, Supported and Priority Services (which includes the actual delivery of the interviews).",Benefit This ensured all impacts were understood both on UK resources provided under one service line and the ScopeRequirements under the International service line.
TP007D,16/07/2019,Security,WWW,Security,,Project Calls,5,,,From a security perspective collaboration on the security assurance aspects worked well. With UKVI leading the assurance and HMPO able to review and contribute where there were areas specific to HMPO. Collaboration across Home Office on security is good.,Benefit This ensured HMPO interests were represented within the overall HO security considerations whilst minimising duplication of effort between HMPO and UKVI
TP007D,19/07/2019,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Ddat,,Project Calls,5,,,"The design of the Flabba service originally shared with HMPO included a number of features such as individual customer accounts and direct contact via their email address which were not suited to current UKVI/HMPO business needs.  These needed immediate work to make the produce better suited to ScopeRequirements and delayed its availability as a working platform (previous contract ended May, new service available Sept 2018) the service has continued to evolve to address issues identified by UKVI since they started using it in Septe 2018.  This has also taken HMPO time and resource to comment and keep abreast of changes.",Impact The Flabba product has changed during the last year from the platform orignally shared by UKVI as a result of changes to remove issues such as individual customer log in accounts linked to their email and roles/responsibilities which has  changed the look of the screens as well as the functionality and training material.
TP007D,19/07/2019,Commercial,EBI,Project,,Project Calls,5,,,"Discussions with wider HMPO colleagues after the broadband procurement had taken place identified an alternative route to obtain a broadband line via a DMR, Demand Management Request via Ddat who can build on exisitng agreements",Impact We did not explore all possible options and may have missed an option which would have delivered a new line in a shorter time period Benefit If we had known about the DMR process this could have provided a more viable and speedy alternative to the traditional procurement through Commerical.
TP007D,19/07/2019,Governance,EBI,Project,,Project Calls,5,,,HMPO are the 'secondary' service consumer - UKVI being the primary customer as they procured and managed the contract direct with Flabba.,"Impact Given that UKVI are the primary consumer of Flabba and the commercial signatory, the service ScopeRequirements are driven primarily by them. HMPO are secondary and as such, had to accept ScopeRequirements being driven in the main by UKVI. This results in trade-offs having to be accepted which do not necessarily represent the best interests of HMPO."
TP100,31/07/2019,Security,WWW,Bisma Khalid,,,5,,,Kept security engaged from an early stage of the project and sat down with them to discuss solution options prior to handover,"Security had input into the project prior to handover, this meant that they were able to provide impacts on all the options before a decision/recommended option was agreed on."

TP100,31/07/2019,ScopeRequirements,WWW,Bisma Khalid,,,5,,,Projet Manager reviewed each item in the ScopeRequirements and queried some aspects resulting in some items being removed from the ScopeRequirements and moved to other projects in situ.,"Allowed the project to be stripped down to the relevant deliverables only reducing overall timescale, cost and better use of resource."
TP100,31/07/2019,Governance,WWW,Mike Wright,,,5,,,Going though project brief before handover,Easily highlighted areas which were lacking in handover document.
TP100,31/07/2019,Governance,EBI,Mike Wright,,,5,,,Ensure sign off on costs is completed via mission board before handover is completed.,Would ensure the project does not pause until next financial year.
TP100,31/07/2019,Commercial,EBI,Mike Wright,,,5,,,The original Access Control contract is between G4 (supplier) and MoJ (landlord) with no contract/contract manager who owns any documentation.,No contract manager located therefore no previous contract information available.

We were late to the CAM process as this requirement was flagged by Customer Services Management around April 2018, meaning tighter deadlines and more chasing of clearances than would otherwise have been required.",We kept to the planned launch date but it required more team resources to push through due to the urgency of clearing the CAM.
PT003,17/05/2019,Commercial,EBI,Steve Cork [stephen.cork@homeoffice.gov.uk],Director General office - proactive comms,Own investigation,5,,,"The HMPO Twitter account required an service from an external supplier to launch [Hootsuite]. As this service was used by another Home Office team it was assumed they were an approved supplier. The first invoice was received May, a month before planned launch, and I discovered that the Purchase Order could not be approved as the other team had not gone through the procurement process. This led to urgent escalations to arrange for the supplier to be added to Adelphi systems.","This did not impact the launch date, but could have. The lesson from this would be to always check the supplier, even if already used by the business."

TP084,28/08/2018,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,14,,,Original ScopeRequirements vs. the highest priority,To begin with the DSST is to offer Level 2 support to OCF2. This is the service with highest risk. As a result DAP and DCS did not have the support they expected from the outset.
TP084,28/08/2018,Design,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,14,,,Adapting to deliver for the most in-need Digital Service (OCF2) and not the original plan (DCS/DAP),Identification of the OCF2 higher priority and flexibility of the project team to change the ScopeRequirements provided excellent benefits.
TP071A,02/11/2016,Governance,WWW,Ceri Evans,Project Team,LL Workshop,16,,,• SCRUM attendance and resource was Identified and maintained throughout the pilot • A reduction in frequency of scrums according the demand for PDF pilot 2 • Supplier Perspective: Better decision making at scrum.

TP066B,04/12/2018,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,LL Workshop,20,,,Tech teams not in place when Discovery completed,Not being involved in rich discussions during Discovery can reduce velocity later as they spend time understanding the design. Discovery would also be richer with knowledge from dev team reps.
TP094,16/05/2019,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Strategy of Brexit Book,"The project had planned for a hard cut over - but switched to a soft cut over, at short notice, when it was clear that there was an extension to Article 50.  The change of approach saved £3m in write off of EU Passports.  The possibility of an extension was not an option when strategy approach agreed and therefore system changes and approach had only been designed on a hard cut over."
TP094,16/05/2019,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Public Announcement of Brexit Book Approach,The Government announced the introduction of the 'Brexit Book' at the end of 2017.  This was done without consultation of HMPO.  This committed HMPO to a specific course of action during uncertain times.
TP094,16/05/2019,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Alignment with HO Strategy,The Home Office DexEU Team were developed after the HMPO Brexit Strategy - there was sometimes a disconnect between their approach and ours.
TP094,16/05/2019,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Brexit Book related Ministerial Submissions,Various submissions went up to the Minister in relation to Brexit.  Each one focussed on a particular aspect.  It may have been better to have a meeitng with key stakeholders to review the approach which may have resulted in a more rounded submission being submitted.  It is harder to broaden the ScopeRequirements when just commenting on the draft of a specific submission.
TP094,16/05/2019,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Ministerial Submission Timetable,"The process of seeking Ministerial approval (via Perm Secs, SpAds etc) means that there can be a delay in receiving the approval required. The process of pre-empting every scenario could result in a too restrictive option"
TP094,16/05/2019,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Ministerial Approval/For Information,Political climate was such that HMPO was under significant scrutiny for operational performance. Submissions had previously been submitted for information later down the line then need submissions for approval rather than further updates.
TP094,16/05/2019,Design,WWW,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Design Approach,The Brexit Book Change Request was split into two parts (Design - Part A) and (Delivery - Part B).  This was considered a good approach and completely separated the two pieces of work during the possible uncertainty around the delivery.
TP094,16/05/2019,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Technical Notice,The issuing of the 97 Government Technical notices dominated our Operational Message of Additional Validity
TP094,16/05/2019,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Proof checking Design,Errors were identified in the design at a later stage
TP094,16/05/2019,Communications,WWW,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Central HMPO EU Exit Mailbox,The structure of the mailbox worked well - when people followed the approach of communicating through the mailbox.  Mailbox worked very well when there was a dedicated resource to manage and track communications.
TP094,16/05/2019,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Email Communications via the Brexit Mailbox,Some of the email chains become very long - with a large number of indiivduals offering opinions.  Often the whole chain had to be re-read to ensure you understood the context.
TP094,16/05/2019,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Deadlines from HO and OGDs,"Deadlines were often sent out from EU Exit, DEXEU, wider Home Office or even OGDs with same day deadlines - or even with 2 hours notice or less.  This is unrealistic timescales - and if urgent deadlines are required stakeholders should phone individuals to inform them of emails."
TP094,16/05/2019,Governance,WWW,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,EU Exit Portfolio,The creation of the EU Exit Portfolio provided better control of the collective reporting ScopeRequirements.  In the early days this was quite onerous but a structred timetable and approach was developed that worked well.
TP094,16/05/2019,Governance,WWW,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,EU Exit Reporting,"The close working of HMPO and the EU Exit Portfolio resulted in HMPO provided good clear, consistent and punctual reporting to the EU Exit Portfolio."
TP094,16/05/2019,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Project ScopeRequirements,The initial ScopeRequirements of the project was just on the Brexit Book - but the wider Brexit activity was handed over from Strategy in mid 2018.  It was unclear in what this incorporated and created significant extra work for a smal team.  HMPO were often the only representative other OGD meetings (eg YellowHammer) when a large number of resources had been brought into HO to manage Brexit
TP094,16/05/2019,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,EU Exit Communications,"HMPO were restricted on what communications they could issue - for the good of the business, customers or Operations due to wider Brexit Political messages. There was often a disconnect between the wider HO/Cabinet Office Political Message around Deal/No Deal - and the impact that would be on Operational delivery of HMPO."
TP094,16/05/2019,Communications,WWW,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,EU Exit Marketing/Public reaction,"We had hoped that the Communications Marketing would bring forward demand, however we did not anticipate the delay in confirmation of a deal/no deal - which ultimately determined whether customers applied or not.  However this did encourage customers to check whether their passport was valid - via the Online Checker."
TP094,16/05/2019,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,CD and Gib Comms,"DeExEU and HO were not best placed to understand the relationship with CD and Gibraltar in terms of the linked, but seaprate issuing authorities and the need to co-ordinate with those juristictions"
TP094,16/05/2019,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Internal Communications,The change of approach resulted in a number of work arounds needing to be put in place to manage the EU stock down.
TP094,16/05/2019,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Additional Validity Restriction,HMPO were not able to pre-warn customers about the removal of the Additional Validity until the Technical Notice was issued - which had an impact on customers and HMPO reputation.
TP094,16/05/2019,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Additional Validity Impacts,Customers did not understand the impacts of the Additional Validity system change as HMPO were not allowed to discuss this being an impact of leaving the EU.
TP094,16/05/2019,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Heightened Volumes,Different Forecasts were submitted regarding the impacts of a No Deal.  Confirmation of what revised Heightened Volumes everyone should be working to were not communicated promptly to suppliers.
TP094,16/05/2019,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Delays to the Brexit Decision,"1) The lack of an overall Brexit Decision had a big impact on customers choosing not to renew early despite the 'in the event of a No Deal' comms. 2) HMPO stakeholders (Customer Assurance, Operations, Project and Suppliers) came together well to deal with outcomes of the Brexit delays"
TP094,16/05/2019,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,News Articles affecting Demand,The impact on Demand of the 'Which Travel' article informing customers that if they did not renew by that Friday that they risked not being able to travel to Europe if a No Deal was realised had not been fully appreciated
TP094,16/05/2019,Technology,WWW,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Online Checker,The online checker was a very useful tool that was able to enable customers to check whether their passport was valid for their travel.  The messaging around the 6 months and additional validity was difficult to understand and the public were not understanding the messaging.  Initial resistence had been received that the message should be communicated by written word.  User Research showed that the written message was very difficult to understand.
TP094,16/05/2019,Technology,WWW,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Online Checker Management,The Online Checker was set up as a quick solution to address a difficult message.  While this achieved this with the public - it had a big impact on the teams implementing this service.  The process for managing the Checker on the Gov.UK pages was very convoluted with minimal value added.
TP094,16/05/2019,Technology,EBI,Project Team,,e,30,,,Online Checker Ownership,"The Online Checker was managed by different owners - the design of the Checker, the location of it on Gov.UK, and the communications, not all of this was co-ordinated or clear."
TP094,16/05/2019,Technology,WWW,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Reminder Texts,The reminder texts were very successful in getting messages out to customers but resource intensive.
TP094,16/05/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Capacity Planning Process,The process of bringing in large volume of Operation staff is a lenghty and time consuming process.  There are known obstacles such as the GDS secrity clearance process.
TP094,16/05/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Capacity Planning - shared resources,Some of the resources that HMPO have access to are shared with other parts of the Home Office.  A number of these were pulled from the HMPO headcount at short notice to shore up other areas of the business
TP094,16/05/2019,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Capacity Planning - report requests,A number of stakeholders in HMPO and Home Office were requesting updates on the progress of the capacity planning.
TP094,16/05/2019,Resources,WWW,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Capacity Planning - security waiver,The security waiver enabled the retention of new resources.
TP094,16/05/2019,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Capacity Planning - small pool,Some Locations are difficult to resource.  Need to look at future viability in those areas.
TP094,16/05/2019,Resources,WWW,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Contingency Planning,There was a good level of Contingency planning and Interventions in place to manage surge in demand.  This was demonstrated during the short spike in demand following the  'Which Travel' article.
TP094,16/05/2019,Technology,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,System Change,"The AMS system change had been designed on a hard cut over.  The change of approach 2 weeks before go live resulted in workaround being put in place that impacted, DLR, DXC and Operations. 2) The system changes across HMPO and the Gipsy systems worked well due to the close co-ordiantion nd alignment of the changes taking place."
TP094,16/05/2019,Communications,WWW,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Change to transition - communications,The Daily calls with operations helped a closer management of the work arounds put in place following the change in approach for Transition.
TP094,16/05/2019,Design,WWW,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Change of Transition Approach,The change from a hard cut over - to a soft cut over - in order to use up remaining EU stock was proposed 3 weeks prior to the transition.  There were numerous impacts - all manageable but collectively caused a huge amount of work for stakeholders across HMPO and with key suppliers to deliver the change.  Additionally - this change of approach would only happen if there was an extension - which we would only likely know the day before the Transition Day.
TP094,16/05/2019,BAU,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Stock Management,"The management of stock was a complicated process - due to the need to run down some stock, hold back on others and re-direct work to other locations."
TP094,16/05/2019,BAU,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Post Dated Applications,Post Dated applications can be issued up to 3 months in advance and needed to be carefully managed to ensure that post dated books were not issued on the old book after the cut off date
TP094,16/05/2019,BAU,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Write off Stock volumes,The level of write off - could have been significant due to the uncertain political situation impacting customer behaviour.
TP094,16/05/2019,Design,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Policy Changes,"The policy changes were completely dependant on whether the UK were leaving the EU with a Deal  or not, therefore it resulted in various policy options being planned and with limited notice to implement them. The the unique polical situation, its resulting political implications along with a change in the book from EU to Non EU made it very difficult to define the policy changes - eg Observations."
TP094,16/05/2019,Governance,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Brexit Budget,The decision to move Brexit related costs to Operations near the end of the financial year had an impact on Operational budgets
TP094,16/05/2019,Stakeholders,EBI,Project Team,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Commercial Management,"1)  We had two major and two minor change requests for this project, it would have been useful to have captured all our ScopeRequirements (including reporting) under one change request.  2)  We had a larger amount of stock prior to the transition due to the lower than anticipated forecast volumes."
TP094,07/06/2019,Governance,EBI,DLR,,Brexit Book Lessons Learned Workshop,30,,,Product Review Process,1) The QREL for the Brexit Book Change Request went backwards and forwards between HMPO and DLR a number of times. 2) New people became involved in the review so re-visited previously discussed and agreed options.
TP031,30/08/2018,Schedule,EBI,Project Team,,LL Call/Workshop,35,,,DXC underestimated the time it would take to deliver this project,Impacted on business needs.

TP031,30/08/2018,ScopeRequirements,EBI,Project Team,,LL Call/Workshop,35,,,The ScopeRequirements for the project should be determined at the beginning of the project as a decision was made to increase the DAC server memory at a late stage in the lifecycle of the project.,Increase of hardware costs
TP031,30/08/2018,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,LL Call/Workshop,35,,,Use conference phone numbers with alternative to 0800: Glen Warburton was dialling in from abroad and could not dial in via 0800. Had to use manual conference facility on the desk phone. Alternative 0207 number was available that could have saved time manually dialling and connecting each call.,This will make holding meetings easier for people dialling in from overseas.
TP031,30/08/2018,Resources,EBI,Project Team,,LL Call/Workshop,35,,,Delay in identifying DXC resource for design on work station which impacted on the work of IBM.,This delayed the completion of the design and build of DAC server and workstations

By way of feedback Carillion could have provided a more joined up service. The hardware assessment and structural survey could have taken place together. Also Carillion did not give Lee much support ahead of time as Lee was originally given the wrong project information, then the correct information was sent after the survey had completed (circa 12:45). This caused confusion and resulted in not engaging with the right HMPO business stakeholders",Impacted effectiveness of technical assurance provided by Carillion
TP031,30/08/2018,Communications,EBI,Project Team,,LL Call/Workshop,35,,,Effective comms with Carillion and sub contractors.
