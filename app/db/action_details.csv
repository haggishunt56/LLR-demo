528,The need to ensure that time is taken to discuss what has happened within the project team. Provide a one to one briefing,,
529,Recommendation: Project teams should identify what works for them and how many channels are needed and agree these upfront. Recommendation: Team to always agree on language to use (especially technical terms) on Slack and which channels to use for various messages/topics.,,
530,"Recommendation: It would be even better if work involving multiple team members had an obvious conclusion and/or a clear decision which would make it much easier to record in the Decisions Log. Recommendation: Definition phase of project to be used to formalise Terms of Reference (ToR), ScopeRequirements creep so impact can be accessed. Recommendation: Get stakeholders involved earlier to help decision making. for instance, organise Show and Tells, during project lifecycle so decision making from stakeholders doesn't impact timeline. Recommendation: Project should always record decisions for future reference. Recommendation: Organisation to ensure projects have autonomy to make project decisions.",,
531,"Recommendation: HMPO to look at how Slack can  be used across all project in future as a means of communication. Action: In future, projects should ensure they get the right license and organisation's view before using Slack (or any communication tools).  Action: As the organisation is looking at moving on to Poise platform, there is likelihood of having some problems on Poise as Slack cannot be accessed via Poise. Hence future teams to discuss communication tools to be used and ensure this is achievable.",,
532,,,
533,Recommendation: Current supplier governance does not seem to work. HMPO should look into reviewing governance and how 3rd party suppliers are managed.,,
534,"Recommendation: Project to ensure user research is started as soon as possible during project lifecycle. Recommendation: Business Design Authority (BDA) to get project team together when project is still in Discovery phase. Recommendation: Look at GDS project phases to understand what HMPO projects can do to align our phases with GDS phases as it has been proved that GDS project phases do work. Recommendation: Remove terminologies like 'ScopeRequirements' from Agile projects and use terms like 'User Stories' etc, which are more Agile terms. Recommendation: Business to look at what is on ground and try and make them better rather than produce what will not be fit for purpose. Recommendation: Project to ensure 'epics' are identified in Design phase. Recommendation: GDS project phases to incorporate design, as this is not currently a part of GDS project phase. Recommendation: Business to establish clear understanding of ScopeRequirements when ScopeRequirements are being delivered by 3rd party suppliers. Project team to also ensure they work closely with the 3rd party project from onset of project. Recommendation: ScopeRequirements need to be clearly written so they are easily understood and need to be considered in the context of an Agile project in that these are open to development as the project progresses and  new information comes to light.",,
535,Recommendation: Include a written test for technical resources during recruitment.,,
536,Action: Other projects to ensure there is a go-to person on the Project who will lead on service management activities.,,
537,Recommendation: Project teams to ensure there is early engagement with all key stakeholders.,,
538,,,
539,Recommendation: Always have an interaction designer on digital service teams. Recommendation: Business to agree risk of not having all required skill set resources on board and to ensure the stakeholders understand what different resources do. Action: Project to be fully funded and resourced,,
540,"Recommendation: Locate teams at the same site, where possible or invest in better communication equipment. Recommendation: If business model is to have teams geographically dispersed, there is a need for organisation to invest in appropriate technology to allow teams work in different locations effectively. Action: Technical Design Authority (TDA) to define technology list of solutions for the future according to ToR setup as framework.",,
541,Conduct a full discovery,,
542,Recommendation: When staff are still learning they should start on smaller projects and allowances should be made for their lack of experience in terms of project timelines. Ideally some of the civil service team members should be experienced with Agile to help less experienced team members.,,
543,Recommendation: Ensure resources are available in the project team to create the prototype.,,
544,Recommendation: Ensure sufficient development resources are available in the project team,,
545,"Recommendation: Use one repository that everyone can access, with sufficient upload limits to accommodate recordings and large slide decks.",,

552,In the future this situation should not occur and a full audit trail should be created from beginning to end so that all assets can be tracked.,,
553,"For future projects, a clear set of instructions should be issued to the closing sites regarding the recording and movement of assets to prevent this problem reoccurring.",,
554,"As above, this was a result of the lack of instructions issued to flexi sites. The assets were moved to various offices and the Systems teams at these offices returned these to the supplier. However, this did not prevent the supplier from cross referencing the assets with CMDB and updating the assets on their location. This would have the problem with assets not being in the stated location on CMDB.",,
555,This a lesson for the supplier to improve and follow the established processes. The supplier state further below in this report that as a result of this project the supplier staff have been reminded about the established procedure for dealing with HMPO assets.,,
556,"In future, HMPO should not assume that the supplier employees are in comms even when they should be.",,
557,The correct procedure has now been recommunicated to the supplier employees to reduce the risk of this happening again.,,
558,Agreed – better communication between the supplier PM and field support regarding the location of the laptops in Charles House would have result in much less wasted time and resource.,,
559,Agreed - this would have solved issues encountered during the project lifespan. As stated previously instructions should be issued to sites before any movement takes place to ensure correct capture of all the assets.,,
560,"Whilst letting the supplier take total control of future projects would be one solution, the supplier have not proven them to be capable of following the agreed asset management processes either.  The internal HMPO asset movement approach was chosen due to the money quoted by the supplier to carry out this work. If the lessons learned by this exercise are followed in future the project foresees no issue with using the internal HMPO approach again.",,
561,This flaw has been highlighted to both HMPO and the supplier’s asset management. HMPO A.M is keen to ensure the correct procedures are followed henceforth and will be working with the supplier to rectify the flaws identified by this project.,,
562,,,
563,"The group were highly critical of the organisation of G27, and going forward the supplier should be careful to keep on top of the assets in their possession.",,
564,In future this is recommended as the assets should be in  the supplier possession by this point.,,
565,,,
566,"As stated previously, HMPO should not take anything for granted and should thoroughly ensure everything is going to plan. This applies to not only the supplier project management but whether documentation (e.g. transport plans) are being produced etc.",,
567,"In future, it is much easier to work through issues over a call rather than e-mail as it resolves the problem much quicker and builds better relationships between stakeholders.",,
568,This is a lesson learned for the supplier and should hopefully mean supplier staff follow the correct processes.,,
569,,,
570,"In future Security should be engaged as early as possible so that they can decide what security processes need to take place.  Whilst an agreement was reached with security to use a mixture of flexi site manager assurance and photographic evidence, this was not ideal and should not be replicated in the future.",,

This resulted in a number of work arounds having to be put in place in order to manage a different approach.  This impacted Operations and two suppliers.

It was often unclear of what the information was being used for or the reason for the very short deadline.

728,"Initial reporting requests were random, at short notice and repetitive.  Over time a structured approach was introduced with a set deadline for requests.
